The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This rule is expected to override the div selector */
}

.container p {
  color: green; /* This style is inherited by the inner p tag */
}

.container div p {
  color: purple; /* This rule is intended to override the inherited green color, but it doesn't! */
}
```

In this example, the `div p` selector within `.container` is expected to override the inherited green color from `.container p` and display purple text. However, due to specificity rules, the inherited `color: green` from the parent `.container p` has higher specificity than `.container div p`, resulting in the text remaining green instead of purple.
