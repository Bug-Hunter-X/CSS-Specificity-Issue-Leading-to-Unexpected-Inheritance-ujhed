To resolve the specificity issue and make the text color purple, you can increase the specificity of the selector `.container div p` by making it more specific. Here's a modified solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container div p {
  color: purple !important; /* Using !important forces the style override */
}
```

Alternatively, changing the structure of your HTML or adding an extra class would provide better solutions which should be preferred over using `!important`.

The `!important` rule should be used sparingly, as overuse can make CSS hard to maintain and debug.  However, it serves as a quick solution for this specific demonstration.
